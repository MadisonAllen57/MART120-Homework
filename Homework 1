GUI vs. CLI
	There are two main ways people can use a computer: through a graphical user interface or a command line interface. Both have their own strengths, and which one works better depends on the person using it. 
	A GUI is the style most people, like myself, are familiar with. The GUI has windows, icons, and buttons you can click on with a mouse. In my opinion it’s easier to understand because you an just see and click what you need without needing to remember certain commands. A downfall of GUI is that it can feel slower sometimes, especially when you go through lots of menus. 
	The CLI is very different. Instead of pictures, it’s just a screen where you type commands. When you first look at it it can seem intimidating and look a lot harder, but when you learn all the commands it can be a lot easier. People who use computers sometimes prefer the CLI because it gives them more control and allows them to do things that a GUI can’t. The problem is that you have to remember all the right commands, even one tiny mistake can mess things up. 
	Overall, GUIs are easier for beginners and everyday use, while CLIs work better for experienced users who want speed and flexibility. Most computers today include both, this way you can pick whichever one you’re more comfortable with.
